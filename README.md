# ðŸŒ± Plant Health Monitoring System

**A smart solution for next-generation agriculture using IoT, AI, and web technologies.**

## ðŸš€ Overview
This project was developed as part of an academic module, focusing on delivering an innovative solution to **monitor plant health** in real time. Leveraging **IoT sensors**, **AI models**, and a responsive **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, the system provides users with insightful data on plant environments and directs them to nearby agricultural centers when support is needed.

## Description

The **Plant Health Monitoring System** is designed to enhance agricultural efficiency and productivity. The PWA allows users to monitor key environmental parameters such as temperature, soil moisture, and humidity in real time. The AI model analyzes the collected data to determine if the conditions are favorable for plant growth. 

Moreover, the system incorporates a location-based feature that identifies the userâ€™s location and suggests the nearest agricultural support centers for additional assistance.

## Installation guide

We made sure that the architecture of the repository was well organized for users to test the project locally or build on it. If you want to run the application locally, please follow the following steps:

    - Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/Amir-Jribi/Fire-Detection
    - Install Wildfly30, with Java 21.
    - Install Nodered on your Raspberry pi and then load the content of embedded folder into your raspberry pi. Feel free to change the sensors and actuators pins, the MQTT broker, and the API link for getting a list of installed sensors.
    - Configure  HTTPS/HSTS for Wildfly.
    - Open microprofile.config.properties and set your settings (certificate path, MQTT broker settings, and you Mongodb link).
    - Move into the Health-monitoring directory and run nvm clean package to install the required dependencies.
    - Deploy the war file created in the target forlder in the deployment folder, and start your wildfly server. 
# Deployment Machine
The Application is also hosted on a virtual machine accessible at https://planthealth.me/
With our school mail, we can get a 100$ voucher inside of Microsoft Azure. With this voucher, we can create a virtual machine capable of hosting the middleware, the mosquitto broker and the database. The virtual machine have the following characteristics:
- Ram: 4GB
- vCPUS: 2
- Ressource disk size: 8GB
# Cerfitication and grading
We have enabled HTTPS with letsencrypt TLS certificate with HSTS enabled as well, ensuring only secure connections are allowed to the middleware.
Enabling TLS1.3 only on wildfly helps to generate A grading on SSLabs.
